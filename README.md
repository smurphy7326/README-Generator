# Professional README Generator

## Description

This README.md generator uses node.js and the inquirer NPM package to ask questions and prompt the user for answers. When it has the information it takes those answers and creates a professional README. README files are able to help students and instructors alike with collaboration on projects. This application is hopefully going to help speed up the process it take to make a README, so they can focus more time on other parts of the project.

With this application feel free to look at this quick b=video to help get started.
